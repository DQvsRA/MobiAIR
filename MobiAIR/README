MobiAIR
An AS3 engine made from the ground up to run as fast as possible on mobile devices using the display list after a lot of trials and errors, iOS in particular, it was tested mostly on iPod 4 and it could render around 130 sprites @ 30 FPS and it was reported to run decently on a 3GS but I did not see it myself.
------------------------
Features:
-Fast rendering of animated sprites on older iOS and other mobile devices
-Tools to prerender vector MovieClips to bitmap frames which would save space and support different resolutions without having to include different sizes
-automatically scale all graphics to match different screen resolutions
-usefull functionality in sprites like playing backwards, looping, animation packages
-automatic screen/scene handling and management with a fast fading transition
-One ENTER_FRAME event updates the whole game you can use it by overriding the update function inside the BaseScreen class
------------------------
How to use:
check out the examples, and there's something important which is the renderMode (CPU/GPU which results in different results depending on the device, and AIR release, here's some examples:
Android phones: always use GPU mode
Blackberry playbook: never notice any difference between the two ... it always runs fast!
iOS:
AIR 2.5 - 2.6: gpu
AIR 2.7: cpu
AIR 3.0+: results are close, but I think gpu runs smoother
-----------------------
Development on this engine is stopped since Stage3D is coming soon to mobile devices which will change everything forever! but its pretty much usable right now.

License: use it however you like!
